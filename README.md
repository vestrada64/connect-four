## How does Connect Four exactly work?
For anyone who is a fan of **strategy** games, Connect four is definitely your kind of game. Playing against an opponent, you try to be the first to place four checkers in a row. Which can result to getting four across going vertical, diagonal, or horizontal.

### Technologies used for Connect Four 
What was used to create this game had to do with several technologies, we'll start with **HTML** (Hypertext Markup Language) for tagging text files to achieve font, color, graphic, and hyperlink effects on the web page. I also used **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) which describes how the HTML element are to be displayed on the screen, which controls the layout of the page. Last but not least **Javascript** (JS) the scripting language, which was used to provide user interaction.
